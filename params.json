These can be downloaded using the *same* password you get from registering for the NKFD software.\r\n\r\n| **Toolbox**                                  | **Version** |\r\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|\r\n| [NETLAB](/netlab/downloadFiles/vrs3p3)       | 3.3         |\r\n| [NDLUTIL](/ndlutil/downloadFiles/vrs0p157)   | 0.157       |\r\n| [MLTOOLS](/mltools/downloadFiles/vrs0p127)   | 0.127       |\r\n| [OPTIMI](/optimi/downloadFiles/vrs0p132)     | 0.132       |\r\n| [DATASETS](/datasets/downloadFiles/vrs0p131) | 0.131       |\r\n| [KERN](/kern/downloadFiles/vrs0p167)         | 0.167       |\r\n\r\nFirst release in response to a request for the code. Code was written in 2000 but is being released for first time in 2007. The code is heavily based on the NETLAB toolbox, to such an extent that copyright from NETLAB probably applies to large portions of this software. Please see GPL licenses on that software for details of the implications of this.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\n### Mixture of Gaussian Example\r\n\r\nRun with demNkfd1. Recreates the toy problem results in the paper.\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\n>> demNkfd1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe results of the script are given in the plot below.\r\n\r\n![](demNkfd1_1.png)![](demNkfd1_2.png)\r\n ![](demNkfd1_3.png)![](demNkfd1_4.png) Results from the first toy problem in the ICML 2001 paper.\r\n\r\n### USPS Example\r\n\r\nRun with demNkfdFourNine. I don't have access to the Cedar CDROM data, but this is a recreation of that experiment with the USPS digits four and nine.\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\n>> demNkfdFourNine \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe results of the script are given in the plot below.\r\n\r\n![](demNkfdFourNine_1.png)![](demNkfdFourNine_2.png)\r\n\r\n### Sky Example\r\n\r\nAnother data set where I currently have no access to the data. Will release if I can find it again!\r\n\r\nPage updated on Wed Dec 12 05:12:33 2007\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-62968536-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
