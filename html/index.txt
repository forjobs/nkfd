<p>This page describes examples of how to use the Noisy Kernel Fisher's Discriminant Software (NKFD).

RELEASEINFORMATION

<p>First release in response to a request for the code. Code was written in 2000 but is being released for first time in 2007.

<h2>Examples</h2>


<h3>Mixture of Gaussian Example</h3>

<p>Run with demNkfd1. Recreates the toy problem results in the paper.

<p><code>
&gt;&gt; demNkfd1
</code>
<p>The results of the script are given in the plot below.

<img src="demNkfd1_3.png" width ="45%"><img src="demNkfd1_4.png" width ="45%">
Results from the first toy problem in the ICML 2001 paper.</center>

<h3>USPS Example</h3>

<p>Run with demNkfdFourNine. I don't have access to the Cedar CDROM data, but this is a recreation of that experiment with the USPS digits four and nine.

<p><code>
&gt;&gt; demNkfdFourNine
</code>
<p>The results of the script are given in the plot below.

<h3>Sky Example</h3>

Another data set where I currently have no access to the data. Will release if I can find it again!
